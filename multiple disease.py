"Use smaller plates and measure portions to avoid overeating.",

"Increase intake of soluble fiber found in oats, nuts, seeds, and fruits like apples and berries.",

"Avoid white bread, pastries, and other refined carbs that can cause blood sugar spikes.",

"Consume healthy fats from sources like avocados, nuts, seeds, and olive oil instead of trans fats or saturated fats.",

      "Lifestyle Tips",

"Combine aerobic exercises (walking, jogging, swimming) with resistance training (weights, bodyweight exercises) for maximum benefits.",

"Drink plenty of water and avoid sugary drinks like soda and fruit juices.",

"Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep per night to regulate hormones that affect blood sugar levels.",

    "Monitoring and Medical Care",

"Visit your doctor regularly to monitor blood sugar levels and assess overall health.",

"If your doctor prescribes medications, take them as directed without skipping doses.",

    "Other Tips",
"Quit Smoking: Smoking increases the risk of type 2 diabetes and other complications.",

"Exercise for Balance and Coordination: Regular exercise, especially activities like walking, tai chi, or yoga, can help improve balance, flexibility, and coordination, which are essential in managing Parkinsonâ€™s disease symptoms.",
"Strength Training: Incorporating weight-bearing exercises can improve muscle strength and reduce the risk of falls.",
"Aerobic Exercise: Activities like swimming, cycling, or dancing can increase blood flow to the brain and potentially reduce the risk of neurodegenerative diseases.",

"2. Eat a Healthy and Balanced Diet",

"Antioxidant-Rich Foods: Include foods high in antioxidants, such as berries, nuts, spinach, and broccoli, to protect the brain from oxidative stress.",
"Omega-3 Fatty Acids: Eat fish like salmon and mackerel or plant-based sources like flaxseeds and chia seeds to support brain health.",
